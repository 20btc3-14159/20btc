            <p>Four years ago today, I lost 20 BTC. </p>
            <p>It was all my fault, I was drinking a lot and Satoshi dice was slowly eating all my coins. I was reading reddit one day about brainwallets and thought if I could put some coins beyond reach, I might be able to hold onto them for the long term.</p>
            <p>I asked my wife to come up with a phrase, something she knew but I didn't, so only she could access the coins. Well... I'm sure you can imagine what happened, but I'll explain it anyway.</p>
            <p>My wife decided on the phrase <strong>"my children are my life"</strong> in her head, type it into some brainwallet generating site and I simply picked up the address and shipped most of my remaining BTC to that address:</p>

            <br/>
            <p>In hindsight, that wasn't a good idea, within 10 seconds, the address was swept and we lost the money.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Za5bWMU.png"/>
            <br/>
            <p>After an initial shock and having a little cry together about how stupid I was. Why o why didn't I at the very least perform a dry run or something? Anyway, after ten mins I thought I would use the <a href="https://blockchain.info/Resources/faq/public_notes1.png">blockchain.info's public note system</a> to send 0.0005 BTC to the swept address and leave a little message:</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mqg0RV2.png"/>
            <br/>
            <p>blockchain.info has since deprecated this feature and later even removed all the messages. I basically said something like <strong>"Please return, those were our savings. Please return if you can"</strong>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Anyway, that's where we left it... I looked back a few times early on, but nothing. It wasn't untll December 2016 that I returned to this address to find the following transactions:</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PXaWjcc.png"/>
            <br/>
            <p>Again, blockchain.info's public notes are gone, but the second transaction, the one that happened at 17:46, had a public note that said something like <strong>"I will return your coins to 18tBuKMnvKsCaYdYnttrX2DsKrGaf7c7hw if you can confirm you still hold that address"</strong>.</p>
            <p>I didn't see this transaction/message for 18 months, not until December 2016. By which time, I found out blockchain.info had removed the ability to create new public notes. So I meekly returned the 0.0012 BTC to the swept address using our original address, bringing the value back to 20 BTC and waited.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Eight months, later, I tried to get smart and use vanity addresses to catch their attention. So on the second anniversary of their message back, I did the following:</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6326Y29.png"/>
            <br/>
            <p>Bringing the final total to the swept address: 20.00314159 BTC</p>
         </div>
         <div id="summary">
            <p>So now, on the fourth anniversary of losing our coins in such a stupid way, my wife and I hope that by bringing this to a wider audience (via a Reddit post) you my might notice and return them to us. Our email address email address is in the signed message at the top of this page if you would like to chat. Yours in hope.</p>
